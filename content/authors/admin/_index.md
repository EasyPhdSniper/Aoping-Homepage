Hello! I'm Aoping, currently a master's student at the School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University, working with my supervisor Dr. Lu Hu. My research interests include emerging mobility technologies, queueing theory, and traffic assignment. Two TRB conference papers I have completed, including collaborations, have been accepted. Moreover, I'm looking for a Ph.D. position!
